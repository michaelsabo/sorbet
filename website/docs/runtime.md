title: Enabling Runtime Checks
---

As we've mentioned before, Sorbet is a [gradual](gradual.md) system: it can be
turned on and off at will. This means the predications `srb` makes statically
can be wrong.

That's why Sorbet also uses **runtime checks**: even if a static prediction was
wrong, it will get checked during runtime, making things fail loudly and
immediately, rather than silently and asynchronously.

In this doc we'll answer:

- What's the runtime effect of adding a `sig` to a method?
- Why do we want to have a runtime effect?
- What are our options if we don't want `sig`s to affect the runtime?

## Runtime-checked `sig`s

Adding a method signature opts that method into runtime typechecks (in addition
to opting it into [more static checks](static.md)). In this sense,
`sorbet-runtime` is similar to libraries for adding runtime contracts.

Concretely, adding a `sig` wraps the method defined beneath it in a new method
that:

- validates the types of arguments passed in against the types in the `sig`
- calls the original method
- validates the return type of the original method against what was declared
- returns what the original method returned[^void]

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

[^void]:
  The case for `.void` in a `sig` is slightly different. See
  [the docs for void](sigs.md#returns-void-annotating-return-types).

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

For example:

```ruby
require 'sorbet-runtime'

class Example
  extend T::Sig

  sig {params(x: Integer).returns(String)}
  def self.main(x)
    "Passed: #{x.to_s}"
  end
end

Example.main([]) # passing an Array!
```

```shell
‚ùØ ruby example.rb
...
Parameter 'x': Expected type Integer, got type Array with unprintable value (TypeError)
Caller: example.rb:11
Definition: example.rb:6
...
```

In this small example, we have a `main` method defined to take an Integer, but
we're passing an Array at the call site. When we run `ruby` on our example file,
sorbet-runtime raises an exception because the signature was violated.

## Why have runtime checks?

Runtime checks have been invaluable when developing Sorbet and rolling it out in
large Ruby codebases like Stripe's. Type annotations in a codebase are near
useless if developers don't trust them (consider how often YARD annotations fall
out of sync with the code... üò∞).

Adding a `sig` to a method is only as good as the predictions it lets `srb` make
about a codebase. Wrong sigs are actively harmful. Specifically, when `sig`s in
our codebase are wrong:

- we can't use them to find code to refactor. Sorbet will think some code paths
  can never be reached when they actually can.
- they're effectively as good as out-of-date documentation, with little added
  benefit over just comments.
- we could never use them to make Ruby code run faster. In the future, we hope
  to use Sorbet types to make Ruby faster, but `sig`s that lie will actually
  make code _slower_ than no types at all.

By leveraging runtime checks, we can gain lots of confidence and trust in our
type annotations:

- Automated test runs become tests of our type annotations!
- Our production observability and monitoring catch bad sigs **early**, before
  they propagate false assumptions throughout a codebase.

Most people are _either_ familiar with a completely typed language (Java, Go,
etc.) or a completely untyped language like Ruby; a
[gradual type system](gradual.md) can be very foreign at first, including these
runtime checks. But it's precisely these runtime checks that make it easier to
drive adoption of types in the long run.

## Disabling runtime checks

Sometimes runtime checks don't make sense. There are two main reasons why

1.  For particularly hot method calls, we might not have the performance budget
    to wrap a method in `sig` checks.

2.  For the purposes of convincing an people to adopt Sorbet widely, we might
    have to make the compromise that adopting Sorbet doesn't affect the runtime
    behavior of the code.

<!-- TODO(jez) Document .on_failure / .checked once API is stable. -->

It's possible to change the runtime behavior by defining callbacks. See
[Runtime Configuration](tconfiguration.md) for more about what callbacks are
available and how to register them.

- [Signatures](sigs.md)

  Method signatures are the primary way that we add static and dynamic type
  checking in our code. Learn the available syntax advanced features of
  signatures.
